# ⏩ DiscussionBoard

A discussion board is a “space” where students can further delve into classroom content. 
It can promote collaboration, and offer individuals room to explore topics, issues, and/or questions. 
The discussion board is an excellent tool for students who may feel more comfortable expressing their understanding of course content in a written format, as opposed to verbally.
